## Repositories

### 1. `britonbaker/sandbox` — PRODUCTION (Wallet Memo)
- **Live URL:** https://walletmemo.com (custom domain)
- **Also:** https://britonbaker.github.io/sandbox
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages (deploys from `gh-pages` branch)
- **Main branch:** `main`
- **What it is:** Wallet Memo — a card-based financial tool (single-page app)
- **Key files:** `index.html`, `style.css`, `js/`
- **⛔ DO NOT push directly to `main` or `gh-pages`**
- **✅ DO:** Create feature branches → open PRs for review
- **Why:** This is the live site. Briton reviews changes from his phone via PRs.

### 2. `clawdbrit/playground` — TEST SITE
- **Live URL:** https://clawdbrit.github.io/playground
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages
- **Main branch:** `main`
- **What it is:** Test/preview mirror of Wallet Memo for trying changes before production
- **✅ Safe to push freely** — this is the sandbox for experimentation
- **Git remote name** (in local repo): `test`

### 3. `britonbaker/britonbaker-site` — PERSONAL SITE
- **Live URL:** https://britonbaker.com
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages
- **Main branch:** `main`
- **What it is:** Briton's personal portfolio/landing page
- **✅ DO:** Create feature branches → open PRs for review
- **Same PR workflow as sandbox**

### 4. `clawdbrit/vault` — PRIVATE (RAM's Memory)
- **Visibility:** Private
- **What it is:** RAM's memory files (daily notes, knowledge graph) — Obsidian-compatible vault
- **Not a code project** — just markdown files
- **No deployment / no Pages**

## Workflow Rules

1. **Production repos (britonbaker/sandbox, britonbaker/britonbaker-site):**
   - Always branch off `main`
   - Open a PR with a clear description
   - Include before/after screenshots for visual changes
   - Wait for briton to review/merge (he checks from his phone)

2. **Test site (clawdbrit/playground):**
   - Push directly to `main` — it's made for testing
   - Use this to preview changes before proposing them to production

3. **Branch naming:** Use descriptive names like `feature/thing` or `fix/thing`

4. **The local repo at `~/clawd/sandbox` has two remotes:**
   - `origin` → `britonbaker/sandbox` (PRODUCTION)
   - `test` → `clawdbrit/playground` (TEST)
   - So `git push origin` = production, `git push test` = test site

## Tech Stack (Wallet Memo)
- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS — no framework, no build step
- Single `index.html` + `style.css` + JS modules
- Hugeicons for icons
- GitHub Pages for hosting
- Custom domain via walletmemo.com

## Who is RAM?
RAM is briton's AI assistant (running on Clawdbot/OpenClaw on AWS). RAM manages the `clawdbrit` GitHub account and handles most development work through PRs. If you see commits from `clawdbrit`, that's RAM.
